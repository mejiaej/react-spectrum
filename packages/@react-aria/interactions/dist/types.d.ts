 * element from inside the window you wish to add. We'll retrieve the relevant elements based on that.
 * Note, you do not need to call this for the default window, as we call it for you.
 *
 * When you are ready to stop listening, but you do not wish to unmount the iframe, you may call the cleanup function
 * returned by `addWindowFocusTracking`. Otherwise, when you unmount the iframe, all listeners and state will be cleaned
 * up automatically for you.
